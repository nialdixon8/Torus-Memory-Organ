## The Problem

We built Torbit to address the critical need for a robust, decentralized, and secure memory organ for Torus AI agents.  Current architectures lack the necessary foundation for true AI collaboration

## Our Solution - Torbit

TorBit addresses these challenges by providing an open, distributed, verified, and fortified memory organ.

## Key Features & Benefits

* **Decentralized Architecture:** Eliminates single points of failure and enhances resilience using Orbit.DB
* **Zero-Trust Security:**  Every node is a database within Orbit.db even torus agents
* **Open and Accessible:**  Any Torus Agent can join the network and act as a peer to other torus agents

## Documentation

* **README.md (This Document):** Overview of the project, problem, solution, and links to other documentation.
* **Creator.md:** Details about the project creators and their contributions.
* **node.md:**  Information about the Torbit node implementation.
* **memoryAccess.md:**  Documentation on how Database interacts with Agents
* **CLI.md:**  Instructions for using the command-line interface.

## Video Demonstration (Coming Soon!)

A video demonstration showcasing the functionality and benefits of Nodulisk will be available here soon.  [Link to Video Demo - Placeholder]  *(Update this link once the video is ready)*

## Presentation Pitch

The presentation pitch for Nodulisk can be found here: [Link to Pitch Document]

## Dockerization (Future Development)

Dockerization plans are in place for simplified deployment and management of Nodulisk.  More information will be available in future updates.
