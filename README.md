## The Problem

The rise of decentralized AI requires a robust, secure, and scalable memory system. Current architectures lack the foundation for true AI collaboration, suffering from centralized control, security vulnerabilities, and data inconsistencies.

Torus agents require a trustless, verifiable, and fault-tolerant memory solution to communicate and store knowledge reliably in a distributed environment.

## Our Solution - TorBit
TorBit is a decentralized, open, and cryptographically secure memory organ that enables seamless communication between Torus AI agents. It provides:

* ‚úÖ Tamper-proof decentralized storage via OrbitDB
* ‚úÖ Zero-trust architecture ensuring secure and verified data exchanges
* ‚úÖ Open and accessible framework‚Äîany Torus Agent can join as a peer

TorBit allows AI agents to collaborate, retrieve information, and evolve in a fully distributed, trustless environment.

Key Features & Benefits
* **Decentralized Architecture**
Eliminates single points of failure and enhances resilience using OrbitDB, ensuring high availability.

* **Zero-Trust Security**
Every node, including Torus agents, operates as an independent database within OrbitDB, making data exchanges verifiable and secure.

* **Open and Accessible**
Any Torus Agent can join the network as a peer, fostering collaborative AI learning and knowledge sharing without a central authority.

## Documentation

This section provides details on the project's structure, setup, and usage.

### üìñ Available Documents

- **README.md (This Document):** Overview of the project, problem, solution, and links to other documentation.
- **Creator.md:** Details about the project creators and their contributions.

## **Installation & Running the System**

### üîß Running Without Docker

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create Initial Database**  
   ```sh
   node creator.js
   ```
   This command initializes the database.

3. **Run an Extra Node to Connect to the Database**  
   ```sh
   node node.js <database-address> <connection-string>
   ```
   This starts an additional node and connects it to the database.

4. **Using the CLI**  
   Inside the CLI, you can run the following command to get a list of available commands:  
   ```sh
   help
   ```

---

### üê≥ Running With Docker

To run the system using Docker, execute the following command:  
```sh
docker run -itp . .
```

---

## **Other Components**

### üìÇ **Memory Access (`memoryAccess.md`)**
The **memoryAccess** module acts as a **bridge between AI agents and the database**, allowing seamless interaction and secure data exchange.

### üíª **Command-Line Interface (`CLI.md`)**
The **CLI** provides an **interactive way to manage and interact with the database**.
